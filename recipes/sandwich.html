    The idea for a boneless baby back rib sandwich, the only downside
    being that they use about 50 myystery ingredients-- ribs not necessarily
    being one of them. That's why you should try This
    easy homemade version with real ribs; simply bake, chill, cut,sauce, finish on the grill
    and boom! one of the best sandwiches i've ever had.
